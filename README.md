### Predict Hospital Readmissions using Text Analytics in MATLAB
**Goal**: Build a model to predict if there will be an unintended readmission within 30 days by analyzing notes of doctors and nurses using text analytics techniques in MATLAB.

For this analysis, MIMIC-III data has been downloaded from https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/ and used to bulid a model to predict hospital readmissions. The steps for accessing the database are outlined here: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/. You will be able to download the data once you obtain credentials to access the it.
